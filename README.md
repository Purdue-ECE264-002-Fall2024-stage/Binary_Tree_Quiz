# Binary Tree Quiz

# Problem Statement
Given a binary tree (not a binary search tree) storing numbers, implement a function (bin_tree_counter) that will count the occurence of each number and print it in the format [number] [count]\n
 
# Example
Binary Tree
    3
  5   4
 5 3 2 7

Will produce output  
2 1  
3 2  
4 1  
5 2  
7 1  

# Criteria
- The order of the output doesn't matter
- The provided header must not be changed
- The output must be printed to stdout
- the binary tree will be created in main and passed as an argument into your function; you do not need to construct it
- All the values in the binary tree will fit in a 32 bit integer

# Instructions
Implement the function and submit helper.c to the gradescope assignment when complete. Make sure to test your program. There will be one test case and a makefile provided. Feel free to write your own tests as well. You are permitted to add any struct definitions/helper functions to the helper.c file.
